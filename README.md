# DS-with-Java

This repository contains my solutions, i.e., executable code to coding questions asked to implement in Coding Ninjas' Data Structures with Java course. Thus, all of the solutions will be in Java only. The soltions have been tested and executed in the coding platform CodeZen of Coding Ninjas.

"Please do not plagiarize these solutions as it will not serve the purpose of the course." 

Thanks to Coding Ninjas for providing such amazing lectures and a platform to start my "true" coding journey with!
